[1mNAME[0m
       gtags - create tag files for global.

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       [1mgtags [22m[-ciIOqvw][-d [4mtag-file[24m][-f [4mfile[24m][[4mdbpath[24m]

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mGtags [22mis used to create tag files for [1mglobal[22m(1).

       [1mGtags  [22mrecursively  collects  source files under the current directory,
       picks up symbols and writes the cross-reference data into the tag files
       ('GTAGS', 'GRTAGS' and 'GPATH').

       If 'gtags.files' exists or the [1m-f [22moption is specified, target files are
       limited by it. Lines starting with '. ' are comments.

       C, yacc, Assembly, Java, C++ and PHP source files are supported.  Files
       whose  names end in '.c', '.h' are assumed to be C source files.  Files
       whose names end in '.y' are assumed to be  yacc  source  files.   Files
       whose  names end in '.s', '.S' are assumed to be Assembly source files.
       Files whose names end in '.java' are assumed to be Java  source  files.
       Files  whose names end in '.c++', '.cc', '.hh', '.cpp', '.cxx', '.hxx',
       '.hpp', '.C', '.H' are assumed to be C++  source  files.   Files  whose
       names  end  in  '.php',  '.php3', '.phtml' are assumed to be PHP source
       files.  Other files are assumed to be text files. Gtags does not  treat
       binary files.

[1mOPTIONS[0m
       The following options are available:

       [1m--accept-dotfiles[0m
              Accept  files  and directories whose names begin with a dot.  By
              default, [1mgtags [22mignores them.

       [1m-c[22m, [1m--compact[0m
              Make 'GTAGS' in compact format.  This option does not  influence
              'GRTAGS', because that is always made in compact format.

       [1m--config[22m[=[4mname[24m]
              Print  the value of config variable [4mname[24m.  If [4mname[24m is not speci-
              fied then print all names and values.

       [1m-d[22m, [1m--dump [4m[22mtag-file[0m
              Dump a tag file as text to the standard output. Output format is
              'key<tab>data'.  This is for debugging.

       [1m--explain[0m
              Explain handling files.

       [1m-f[22m, [1m--file [4m[22mfile[0m
              Browse  through  all  files whose names are listed in [4mfile[24m.  The
              argument [4mfile[24m can be set to '-' to accept a list of  files  from
              the standard input.  File names must be separated by newline.

       [1m--gtagsconf [4m[22mfile[0m
              Set environment variable [1mGTAGSCONF [22mto [4mfile[24m.

       [1m--gtagslabel [4m[22mlabel[0m
              Set environment variable [1mGTAGSLABEL [22mto [4mlabel[24m.

       [1m-I[22m, [1m--idutils[0m
              In addition to tag files, make ID database for [1midutils[22m(1).

       [1m-i[22m, [1m--incremental[0m
              Update  tag  files  incrementally.  It's better to use [1mglobal[22m(1)
              with the [1m-u [22mcommand.

       [1m-O[22m, [1m--objdir[0m
              Use BSD-style objdir as the location of tag files.  If '$MAKEOB-
              JDIRPREFIX'  directory  exists,  [1mgtags  [22mcreates '$MAKEOBJDIRPRE-
              FIX/<current directory>' directory and makes tag  files  in  it.
              If [4mdbpath[24m is specified, this option is ignored.

       [1m--single-update [4m[22mfile[0m
              Update  tag files for a single file.  It is considered that [4mfile[0m
              was added, updated or deleted, and there is no change  in  other
              files.  This option implies the [1m-i [22moption.

       [1m--skip-unreadable[0m
              Skip unreadable files.

       [1m--sqlite3[0m
              Use  Sqlite 3 API to make tag files. By default, BSD/DB 1.85 API
              is used.  To use this  option,  you  need  to  invoke  configure
              script with [1m--with-sqlite3 [22min the build phase.

       [1m--statistics[0m
              Print statistics information.

       [1m-q[22m, [1m--quiet[0m
              Quiet mode.

       [1m-v[22m, [1m--verbose[0m
              Verbose mode.

       [1m-w[22m, [1m--warning[0m
              Print warning messages.

       [4mdbpath[24m The  directory in which tag files are generated.  The default is
              the current directory.

       'gtags.files'
              The list of candidates of target files.

[1mENVIRONMENT[0m
       The following environment variables affect the execution of [1mgtags[22m:

       [1mGTAGSCACHE[0m
              The size of the B-tree cache. The default is 50000000 (bytes).

       [1mGTAGSCONF[0m
              Configuration  file.  About the default, please see 'gtags.conf'

       [1mGTAGSFORCECPP[0m
              If this variable is set, each  file  whose  suffix  is  '.h'  is
              treated as a C++ source file.

       [1mGTAGSFORCEENDBLOCK[0m
              If  this  variable is set, each } at the first column brings end
              of block of 0 level.

       [1mGTAGSLABEL[0m
              Configuration label. The default is 'default'.

       [1mGTAGSLOGGING[0m
              If this variable is set, '$GTAGSLOGGING' is  used  as  the  path
              name of a log file. There is no default value.

       [1mGTAGS_OPTIONS[0m
              The value of this variable is inserted in the head of arguments.

       [1mMAKEOBJDIR[0m
              If  this  variable  is set, '$MAKEOBJDIR' is used as the name of
              BSD-style objdir. The default is 'obj'.

       [1mMAKEOBJDIRPREFIX[0m
              If this variable is set, '$MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX' is used as the pre-
              fix of BSD-style objdir. The default is '/usr/obj'.

       [1mTMPDIR [22mThe  location  used  to  stored  temporary files. The default is
              '/tmp'.

[1mCONFIGURATION[0m
       The following configuration variables affect the  execution  of  [1mgtags[22m.
       You  can  see  the  default  value  for each variable with the [1m--config[0m
       option.

       gtags_parser (comma separated list)
              Specify the mapping of language names and plug-in parsers.  Each
              part  delimited  by  the  comma consists of the language name, a
              colon, the shared object path, an optional colon followed  by  a
              function  name.  If the function name is not specified, 'parser'
              is assumed.  As a special exception, [1mgtags [22mcollects values  from
              multiple gtags_parser variables.

       icase_path (boolean)
              Ignore  case  distinctions  in  the  path.   Suffixes  check  is
              affected by this capability.

       langmap (comma separated list)
              Language mapping. Each comma-separated map consists of the  lan-
              guage  name,  a colon, and a list of file extensions.  As a spe-
              cial exception, [1mgtags  [22mcollects  values  from  multiple  langmap
              variables.  Default mapping is:
              'c:.c.h,yacc:.y,asm:.s.S,java:.java,cpp:.c++.cc.hh.cpp.cxx.hxx.hpp.C.H,php:.php.php3.phtml'.

       skip (comma separated list)
              [1mGtags [22mskips files and directories which are given in this  list.
              As a special exception, [1mgtags [22mcollects values from multiple skip
              variables.  If the value ends with  '/',  it  is  assumed  as  a
              directory  and  [1mgtags  [22mskips  all files under it.  The value may
              include glob patterns (*, ?, [...],  [!...],  [^...]).   If  the
              value  starts  with '/', it is assumed a relative path name from
              the root directory of the project. You cannot use glob  patterns
              for a path name.

       Addition  to  these,  the  variables  listed in the ENVIRONMENT section
       except for GTAGSCONF and GTAGSLABEL are also available as configuration
       variables.   Each environment variable is given more priority than con-
       figuration variable of the same name.

[1mBUG[0m
       'GTAGS' and 'GRTAGS' are very large.  In advance of using this command,
       check the space of your disk.

       Assembly  support  is  far from complete.  It extracts only ENTRY() and
       ALTENTRY() from source file.  Probably valid only for FreeBSD and Linux
       kernel source.

       There is no concurrency control about tag files.
